# Machine Learning for Medical Accelerator Optimization

## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the end-of-year project at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Carthage, is titled "Development of a Computer Model Based on Learning Methods to Automate Planning for External Radiotherapy Treatment". It has been crafted under the supervision of Dr. Youssef El Mahroug, with contributions from distinguished academics and professionals within the field.

### Background
External beam radiation therapy is an established method for treating various types of cancer, utilizing high-energy ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells. The precision in delivering a targeted dose of radiation while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues is paramount for the success of this treatment. Traditional methods for determining beam parameters, while effective, are often slow and susceptible to human error, underscoring the need for enhancements through automation.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of determining initial beam parameters for the Varian 2100 linear accelerator using machine learning techniques. This involves using a trained neural network model to predict initial beam energy parameters based on data generated from extensive simulations with PRIMO softwareâ€” a tool based on the Monte Carlo statistical method.

### Innovation
By integrating artificial intelligence into the planning phase of external radiotherapy, the project aims to significantly enhance treatment efficiency and accuracy. This model provides a pivotal step towards dose optimization, crucial for improving patient treatment outcomes. Additionally, the flexibility of the model allows for future adaptations to include a broader range of beam parameters, potentially revolutionizing the approach to radiotherapy treatment planning.

### Methodology
The approach is rooted in the application of artificial neural networks, specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), to model and predict the necessary radiation dose distributions. Data for training the model is sourced from simulated outputs of the PRIMO software, ensuring a robust foundation for the neural network's learning process.
